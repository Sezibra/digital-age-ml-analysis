Introduction The digital revolution has ushered in a transformative era for governmental operations. As early as the 1990s, terms such as “Elec tronic Government” and “Digital Government” began to appear in literature, highlighting innovative collaborations between Western governments and IT companies. In 1993, the United States officially recognized the concept of “Electronic Government” in its publication, “The National Performance Review.” This document emphasized the potential of advanced information technology to address administrative inefficiencies and enhance service delivery in government. It proposed principles that remain relevant today, including seamless service, paperless operations, one-stop solutions, customer-centric processes, universal access, privacy protection, digital signatures, and cyberse curity. After 2012, Western governments shifted their terminology to wards “digitization” or “Digital Government.” For instance, in 2012, the United States published a report titled “Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People,” and the United Kingdom launched the “Government Digital Strategy” in the same year. In academia, the paper “Reinventing Government” discussed the concept of “One-stop, Non-stop” electronic governance (Osborne, 1993). More recent concepts include automated administrative decision-making (Roehl and Hansen, 2024), digital public goods and services (Shulz, 2024), and digital resilience (Mamediieva and Moyni han, 2023). Both Europe and Asia Pacific countries are actively promoting the digital transformation of their governments. The European Commission has adopted the Digital Europe Programme to support Europe's digital transition and cybersecurity. The eGovernment Benchmark report of 2022 shows that 35 countries in Europe are providing and promoting eGovernment services. In Japan, a report by McKinsey, “Using digital transformation to thrive in Japan's new normal,” suggests that digital transformation can help Japanese businesses thrive in the new normal. To address emerging challenges, the Japanese government has estab lished an agency responsible for digital transformation. Other Asia Pa cific countries have also made significant progress in this area (Priharsari et al., 2023). Within the landscape of global governmental digitalization, China exhibits certain pronounced characteristics. Foremost among these is China's position as one of the earliest nations to elevate the construction of a digital government to a national strategic level. In 2022, the State Council of China issued the “Guidelines for Strengthening the Con struction of Digital Government,” signaling the government's view of digital transformation as a pivotal tool for augmenting governance ca pabilities and efficiencies. This policy emphasized the creation of a “synergistically efficient digital government capability system” and * Corresponding authors. E-mail addresses: gumr3@mail2.sysu.edu.cn (M.

chunk_002,Unknown,790,1,"proposed the strategic goal of “coordinated advancement of the inten sive construction, interconnectivity, and collaborative linkage of gov ernment application systems across various industries and fields.” This focus indicates that the Chinese government's commitment goes beyond merely introducing digital technologies; it is also deeply invested in leveraging these technologies to reform and innovate administrative management and services, thereby enhancing governmental performance. Secondly, China's rapid economic expansion serves as a potent catalyst for governmental digital transformation. Over the past two decades, China's brisk economic and societal growth has presented the government with increasingly complex governance challenges. Digital transformation is perceived as an effective solution that can help gov ernments improve decision-making efficiencies, optimize resource allocation, and enhance the quality and efficiency of public services. This rapid economic progression also drives the development and improvement of digital infrastructure, fosters technological innovation capabilities, and provides robust support for the construction of a digital government. Lastly, the inception of a digital government aligns with the strong public demand for governmental reform in China. Historically, the opacity of governmental affairs has, to some extent, affected public trust in the government. Digital transformation serves to enhance govern ment transparency, enabling the public to better understand and su pervise governmental decisions and actions (Stratu-Strelet et al., 2023). Consequently, the construction of a digital government is not merely a governmental necessity but also an integral pathway to satisfying public expectations and boosting public trust. Given the synergistic impact of national policies, economic devel opment, and public demand, the digital transformation of the Chinese government has witnessed rapid progression. According to statistics from the United Nations E-Government Knowledgebase (UNeGovKB), China's E-Government Development Index surged from 0.41595 in 2003 to 0.8119 in 2022, reflecting an average annual growth rate of 3.79 % (see Fig. 1). Although there remains a modest gap compared to the approximate average of 0.9 seen in developed countries, it is foreseeable that China's digital governmental transformation will reach the level of developed countries in the coming years. The digital transformation of the Chinese government has gradually formed a unique development model, offering valuable insights for other countries and regions. This research provides essential insights into how digital trans formation enhances governmental efficiency, addressing the need for improved public sector performance in the digital age. By developing a comprehensive production network model, the study highlights the mechanisms through which digital transformation impacts efficiency across various government departments. This knowledge is crucial for practitioners, policymakers, and the broader audit community. For practitioners, the findings guide the design and implementation of dig ital transformation projects, helping prioritize efforts and resources for maximum impact. Policymakers can use the insights to craft policies that support interdepartmental collaboration and integrated digital plat forms, optimizing the use of public funds. For auditors, the study offers a framework for assessing the effectiveness of digital initiatives, enabling more accurate and actionable recommendations. Addressing these is sues leads to more efficient, transparent, and responsive government services, ultimately enhancing public trust and societal well-being. Extensive research has been conducted on digital government from various perspectives. We visualize the temporal distribution and emerging trends in this field. Using text mining and Citespace infor mation visualization software, we analyzed literature published in WOS core journals since 2005 on “Digital transformation” and “Government governance,” identifying 174 English articles. Fig. 2 shows the co- occurrence map and prevalent terminologies within digital govern ment research. The co-occurrence map (left) reveals that although government digital transformation began in 2005, the research focus intensified post-2017. Pre-2017 literature emphasized transformation methods and processes, such as information systems and disclosure. Post-2017, “Digital government” became a mainstream term, and the literature began to focus on policy, public sector challenges, and the impacts of digital transformation. Research on the influencing factors of digital government has pri marily focused on themes such as knowledge, technology, cooperation, and policy. Pittaway and Montazemi (2020) emphasized the importance of managers mastering the transfer of critical knowledge through public- private partnerships to promote the digital transformation of local governments. Effective knowledge management and dissemination are crucial foundations for the successful digital transformation of govern ment entities. In terms of inter-agency cooperation, Gasco-Hernandez et al. (2022) expanded our understanding of collaboration within digital government settings, finding that leadership, governance, technology, and collabo rative capabilities contribute to varying degrees of effectiveness in cooperation. This highlights the central role of collaboration in advancing digital government, especially in sharing resources and in formation across multiple agencies. On the technological front, the complexity of digital government becomes apparent. Magnusson et al. (2020) pointed out the necessity of implementing ambidextrous IT governance in the public sector to balance innovation and efficiency, indicating the critical need to strike a balance between technological innovation and day-to-day operations. Additionally, Van Noordt and Fig. 1. E-Government Development Index in some countries. Sources: UN E-Government Knowledgebase (UNeGovKB). C. Yang et al.

chunk_003,Unknown,878,1,"Misuraca (2022) provided a comprehensive analysis that highlighted the importance of high-quality data and other environmental and organi zational factors in the successful adoption of AI systems in the public sector. This study underscores the key challenges and success factors in technology adoption. Regarding policy, Chung and Kim (2019) conducted a comparative study on e-government acts in Korea and the United States, revealing that promoting digital government policy directly from the budget- managing department or establishing a dedicated organization under that department ensures close coordination with the budget, which is critical for IT-driven digital government transformation. Ricciardi et al. (2019) emphasized the active role of governments in evaluating and monitoring digital health services and technologies, underscoring the importance of establishing necessary infrastructure. In the context of e-government implementation, Gallego-Alvarez et al. (2010) conducted a comparative study of 81 major cities world wide, finding that despite political differences, countries are actively promoting dynamic and participatory e-government. However, the challenges and opportunities faced by different nations in digital gov ernment transformation vary significantly. The effects of governmental digital transformation are manifold and have been widely confirmed by various studies. Kuhlmann and Heuberger (2023) highlighted the chal lenges faced during the digital transformation process at the local gov ernment level in Germany, particularly the potential negative impacts on public employees and citizens. In contrast, O'Neill (2009) and Umbach and Tkalec (2022) argued that the impact of e-government in New Zealand was largely superficial, cautioning against the complexity of assessing digital public services. These findings underscore the context-sensitive nature of evaluation criteria, suggesting that digital transformation does not always lead to improved service quality or efficiency. Private sector integration into public administration (GovTech) is another critical aspect of digital transformation. Bharosa (2022) warned of the risk that decision-making power may shift from the public to the private sector due to knowledge gaps in technology. Martins and Veiga (2022) found that the digitization of government could make business environments more favorable by reducing administrative and regulatory burdens. However, this shift also poses challenges, potentially disrupt ing the balance of power between the public and private sectors. In the co-production of public services, Nicholls (2019) cautioned against the assumption that web-based service delivery always leads to better outcomes. His study of English local government showed no clear correlation between web development and improved performance or cost-effectiveness. Further research indicates that digital transformation may contribute to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Develop ment Goals, but leadership plays a crucial role in this transformation (Ufua et al., 2021; Tassabehji et al., 2016). Cappelli et al. (2023) and Upadhyay et al. (2022) explored the potential of digitalization to enhance transparency and foster user engagement with government platforms, thus improving governance. However, they also highlighted the need for balanced integration with anti-corruption strategies to avoid potential risks. Ingrams (2019) and Rodrigues et al. (2023) expanded this discussion to include public values and ‘smart’ city governance, pointing out the risk of technocratic imbalances and emphasizing the importance of ICT in responding to disruptive events like pandemics. Lastly, Larson and Park (2014) provided insights into the state's role in shaping digital transformation, using South Korea's successful ICT-driven development as an example. They argued that a competent bureaucracy and a political system that grants sufficient autonomy to the bureaucracy were key contributors to this success. In summary, these studies illuminate the multifaceted impacts of digital transformation in government, highlighting the complexity and implications for public services, private sector integration, public participation, and broader social implications. It is clear that the effects of digital transformation are far-reaching and context-dependent, of fering both opportunities and challenges for governments worldwide. In comparison to prior research, this study offers several potential contributions. Firstly, distinct from the vast body of research focusing on the impact of government digital transformation on the economy, so ciety, and the environment, this paper approaches the essence of gov ernment digital transformation from the perspective of its own efficiency, exploring the fundamental goal of enhancing the govern ment's own capabilities. Secondly, departing from the conventional literature that perceives digital government as a holistic entity, this paper introduces a novel theoretical framework that integrates pro duction network theory with the concept of digital transformation, constructing a model that encompasses multiple government de partments. By applying more sophisticated theories to elucidate the complexities of digital government, this framework provides new in sights that advance the field of digital government research. Thirdly, this paper empirically identifies the heterogeneity in the impact of digital transformation across different types of government departments on overall government efficiency. The results show that the digital trans formation of departments with greater independence has the least effect on improving government efficiency. Lastly, this paper substantiates the conflict between the lack of coordination in digital transformation among government departments and the benefits derived from such transformation, emphasizing the necessity of adopting systematic thinking in the development of digital government. The structural arrangement of the subsequent text is as follows: The second section entails theoretical analysis and hypothesis formulation, the third section elucidates variable specifications and model settings, the fourth section showcases and deliberates empirical findings, and finally, the conclusion of this paper. 2.

chunk_004,Unknown,1083,0,"the government must meticulously discharge its prescribed duties. Composed of a multitude of diverse departments, the effective execution of governmental functions hinges on the harmonious cooperation and diligent performance of each constituent part (Galizzi et al., 2023). Each governmental department incurs substantial costs to fulfill its mandate, including investments in time, human capital, and financial resources. For instance, the implementation of governmental responsibilities ne cessitates the employment of public servants and significant financial outlays to ensure the smooth operation of governmental entities. Consequently, we can perceive a governmental institution as a unique enterprise (Gong et al., 2020), where inputs comprise human labor, capital, and machinery, and the outputs constitute societal stability and economic growth. For example, the resources deployed by a police department include law enforcement officers and various equipment, producing outcomes such as reduced crime rates and enhanced safety for local residents (Liu et al., 2019). The Federal Reserve Board, responsible for implementing monetary policy in the United States, invests in staff and experts to conduct economic research and analyze financial data. This enables the Federal Reserve to make informed decisions regarding interest rates and money supply, ultimately contributing to stable and steady economic development by controlling inflation and unemployment rates. Addi tionally, the Environmental Protection Agency allocates resources to environmental scientists, inspectors, and regulatory enforcement offi cers to ensure compliance with environmental laws, leading to improved public health and conservation of natural resources. Viewing a governmental department as a specialized enterprise al lows for a defined methodology to measure governmental efficiency: the lower the cost required by the government to fulfill identical duties, the higher its efficiency (Gawande and Wheeler, 1999). For instance, the use of taxation technology can greatly improve the productivity of tax bu reau employees during income tax collection from enterprises (Mansell, 2021; Okunogbe and Tourek, 2024), reducing the time and human resource costs needed for the tax bureau to fulfill its function, thereby enhancing its efficiency. Similarly, the Department of Motor Vehicles can utilize online platforms to streamline the process of issuing driver's licenses and vehicle registrations, reducing wait times and operational costs (Khojastehpour et al., 2022). Network thinking has a foundation in the study of public sector is sues, but it has not yet formally developed into the production network theory. As early as 2006, Brandsen and Hout (2006) mentioned that organizations involved in the provision of public services are evolving towards a networked production form, in which the production process takes shape across many different organizations. Bardach (2017) noted that “clusters of organizations making at least modest efforts to collab orate on implementing joint solutions to public sector problems are often called ‘networks.’” Alford and Phillips (2018) contribute to the growing demand for a more robust political economy of governance in GVC/GPN debates, where the key governance functions of the state can be classified as facilitative, regulatory, and distributive in nature. Hadid et al. (2023) used social network analysis (SNA) to analyze the role of collaboration networks in public construction projects within KSCPs. Existing public service ecosystems are used to understand how multiple actors co-produce public services and create public value (Haug, 2023), which suggests the feasibility of applying production network thinking to public sector issues. This study makes a theoretical contribution by introducing a framework that integrates production network theory with the concept of digital transformation within the public sector. While network thinking has been applied to public sector issues, this research extends and formalizes it within the context of production network theory, specifically addressing how digital transformation across various governmental departments can influence overall governmental effi ciency. This approach not only advances the theoretical understanding of public sector operations but also provides a new lens through which to examine the interconnectedness and interdependencies of governmental functions. By applying production network theory, our model offers a more sophisticated analysis of the impact of digital transformation, allowing us to capture the complex interactions between different gov ernment departments and their collective influence on societal out comes. This theoretical framework fills a critical gap in the literature, which has often treated digital government as a monolithic entity, neglecting the nuanced and differential impacts of digitalization across various departments. Let us postulate the existence of N distinct governmental de partments, each performing varied governmental duties. We further hypothesize a virtual “final” department, whose role involves consoli dating the functions of each department, consequently affecting society (as illustrated in Fig. 3). We shall analyze this quandary within the analytical framework propounded by Baqaee and Farhi (2020). Each department possesses a characteristic function to gauge the relationship between inputs and outputs. For the governmental department i, its function takes the following form: yi = [( γL i (zi)Li )1−αi(zi)( γM i (zi)Mi )αi(zi) ]1−mi ( ∏ N j=1 x ωij ij )mi (1) Eq. (1) defines Li as the number of employees in governmental department i, while Mi signifies the quantity of machinery employed by the same department. Additionally, the fulfilment of the department's own governmental duties necessitates the involvement of other de partments, such as a policy formulation department requiring informa tion from other entities to ensure policy rationality. Here, zi represents the degree of the government's digital transformation. γL i (zi) and γM i (zi) correspond to the technological levels of labor and machinery, respec tively. αi(zi) is utilized to gauge the significance of machinery to the governmental department. Given a set of governmental duties, the government seeks to minimize the cost of input, which can be expressed as: min (xij) N j=1,Li,Mi ∑ N j=1 ( 1 −τij ( zi, zj ) ) pjxij + wLi + rMi (2) st.yi ≥1 (3) wherein w, r, and pj denote the costs associated with labor, machinery, and utilizing the output of other departments respectively. τij ( zi, zj ) embodies the communication cost between governmental departments i and j, denoted as an “iceberg cost.” γL i (zi), γM i (zi), αi(zi), and τij ( zi, zj ) correspond to the distinct impacts brought by the government's digital transformation: a. With the escalation in the degree of governmental digital trans formation, the efficiency of government employees consequently improves. This effect is captured by asserting dlnγL i (zi) dlnzi > 0, simulta neously presuming d2lnγL i (zi) d(lnzi)2 < 0. b. As the extent of governmental digital transformation enhances, outdated machinery is replaced by more advanced alternatives, and the technology level of machinery heightens. This effect is captured by asserting dlnγM i (zi) dlnzi > 0, concurrently assuming d2lnγM i (zi) d(lnzi)2 < 0. c. With the augmentation of the government's digital transformation degree, an increasing number of tasks traditionally completed by humans become automated. This shift leads to a reduction in the department's dependence on personnel. This effect is captured by asserting dlnαi(zi) dlnzi > 0, whilst hypothesizing d2lnαi(zi) d(lnzi)2 < 0. d. As the level of government digital transformation advances, the cost of inter-departmental communication decreases. Evidently, a coor dinated digital transformation degree between departments is requisite to effectively reduce communication costs. To capture this C. Yang et al. Technological Forecasting & Social Change 208 (2024) 123722 4"
chunk_005,Unknown,402,0,"effect, we assert dlnτij ( zi, zj ) to be an increasing function of dlnzi × dlnzj, denoted as: dlnτij ( zi, zj ) = f ( dlnzi × dlnzj ) (4) This implies that a single department's digital transformation cannot lower communication costs alone. This framework allows us to scruti nize the coordination of the government's digital transformation more meticulously. Furthermore, we hypothesize τij ( zi, zj ) = τji ( zi, zj ) , denoting that communication costs are symmetrical. The a and b signify the technological advancement effects induced by digital transformation (Acemoglu, 2002), c represents the substitution effects introduced by digital transformation (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018), while d pertains to the effects of reduced communication costs rendered by the digital transformation. Solving for the optimization problem of government department i, the cost of department i performing a unit function can be calculated as: pi = (w1−αirαi) 1−mi ( ∏ N j=1 [( 1 −τj ) pj ]ωij )mi [( γL i (1 −αi) )1−αi( γM i αi )αi ]1−mi ( ∏ N j=1 ω ωij ij )mi (5) We assume that labor costs remain constant at w, and machine costs remain constant at r, and r w < γM i γL i , implying that replacing labor with machines will inevitably result in cost reduction. Differentiating Eq. (4) yields: dlnpi = −ΔL i −ΔM i −Δα i −Δτ i + ∑ N j=1 miωijdlnpj (6) ΔL i = (1 −mi)(1 −αi)dlnγL i (7) ΔM i = (1 −mi)αidlnγM i (8) Δα i = (1 −mi) [( lnγM i −lnγL i ) −(lnr −lnw) ] dlnαi (9) Δτ i = ∑ N j=1 miωijdlnτi,j (10) Eqs. (6), (7), (8), and (9) measure the impact of changes in γL i (zi), γM i (zi), αi(zi) and τij ( zi, zj ) on government department efficiency, respectively. Writing Eq. (5) in matrix form gives: dlnp = −ΔL −ΔM −Δα −Δτ + Ωdlnp (11) In Eq. (10), dlnp is an N × 1 matrix, where the i-th element is dlnpi; ΔL is an N × 1 matrix, where the i-th element is ΔL i ; ΔM is an N × 1 matrix, where the i-th element is ΔM i ; Δα is an N × 1 matrix, where the i-th element is Δα i ; Δτ is an N × 1 matrix, where the i-th element is Δτ i ; and Ω is an N × N matrix, where the ij-th element is miωij. Solving Eq. (10) yields: dlnp = −(I −Ω)−1ΔL −(I −Ω)−1ΔM −(I −Ω)−1Δα −(I −Ω)−1Δτ (12) We have already carried out a detailed analysis of the impact of digital transformation on a single government department. Next, we will consider the overall efficiency impact of digital transformation on the government. Assume the function of the “final” department is: Y = ∏ N i=1 cvi i (13) The Y is the output of the “final” department, and ci is the input required by the “final” department from department i. Given a govern ment's responsibilities, the “final” department will also choose the input that minimizes cost, that is: min (ci)N i=1 P = ∑N i pici (14) st.Y ≥1 (15) The P is the cost that the ""final"" department needs to bear to fulfill one unit of function, and pi is the cost of using the output of department i. Differentiating P yields: dlnP = ∑ N i vidlnpi (16) Written in matrix form, this becomes: dlnP = vʹdlnp (17) Fig. 3. Theoretical framework of digital transformation of government departments. C. Yang et al. Technological Forecasting & Social Change 208 (2024) 123722 5"
chunk_006,Unknown,709,0,"In Eq. (15), v represents an N × 1 matrix where the i-th element is denoted by vi. If dlnP < 0, it signifies a decrease in the cost required by the government to fulfill the same governmental duties. Consequently, there is a corresponding change in the government's efficiency E, as follows: dlnE = −dlnP = −vʹdlnp (18) Substituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (16) yields: dlnE = λʹΔL + λʹΔM + λʹΔα + λʹΔτ (19) In Eq. (18), λʹ = vʹ(I −Ω)−1 where the i-th element is denoted by λi, indicating the significance of the department in question (Carvalho and Tahbaz-Salehi, 2019). In order to visually demonstrate the impact of the digital transformation of varying departments on government efficiency, Eq. (18) can be expanded to: dlnE = ∑ N j=1 λjΔL j + ∑ N j=1 λjΔM j + ∑ N j=1 λjΔα j + ∑ N j=1 λjΔτ j (20) Hence, the impact of the digital transformation of the i-th depart ment on governmental efficiency can be expressed as: dlnE dlnzi = λi ( ̂Δ L i + ̂Δ M i + ̂Δ α i ) (21) In Eq. (20), ̂Δ L i , ̂Δ M i and ̂Δ α i are defined as follows: ̂Δ L i = (1 −mi)(1 −αi) dlnγL i dlnzi > 0 (22) ̂Δ M i = (1 −mi)αi dlnγM i dlnzi > 0 (23) ̂Δ α i = (1 −mi) [( lnγM i −lnγL i ) −(lnr −lnw) ] dlnαi dlnzi > 0 (24) The digital transformation of a government department i will affect government efficiency, and since different government departments have varying functional roles and are differently affected by digital transformation, the impact of digital transformation on government efficiency also differs. When considering simultaneous digital trans formation in two departments (i and j), the impact on government ef ficiency can be depicted as: dlnE dlnzi /dlnE dlnzj = λi ( ̂Δ L i + ̂Δ M i + ̂Δ α i ) λj ( ̂Δ L j + ̂Δ M j + ̂Δ α j ) (25) The comparative impact of the digital transformation of Government Department i and j on governmental efficacy is influenced both by the relative significance of the departments and the complexity of the digital transformation process. In considering a scenario where Departments i and j are simulta neously undergoing digital transformation, their combined impact on governmental efficiency may be represented as follows: dlnE = δij + δτ (26) δij = λi ( ̂Δ L i + ̂Δ M i + ̂Δ α i ) dlnzi + λj ( ̂Δ L j + ̂Δ M j + ̂Δ α j ) dlnzj (27) δτ = fʹ( dlnzi × dlnzj )( λimiωij + λjmjωji ) (28) When multiple government departments undergo digital trans formation, it leads to a reduction in inter-departmental communication costs, thereby enhancing overall governmental efficiency. The impact of digital transformation on efficiency in Departments i and j diminishes with increased digital adoption, making the relative extent of digital transformation among different departments a crucial factor influencing government efficiency. Based on these observations, we propose the following hypotheses: H1. The digital transformation of government departments promotes governmental efficiency. H2. The effect of digital transformation on governmental efficiency varies among different government departments. H3. High coordination of digital transformation efforts can enhance its contribution to government efficiency. 3. Empirical design 3.1. Data method and description This study utilizes data spanning from 2012 to 2022 from 31 prov inces across China. The rationale for selecting provincial-level data lies in its robust representative nature. Provincial data often presents a more nuanced portrait of the region's overall government digital trans formation progress, given its expansive geographical and demographic coverage. Conversely, city-level data might be susceptible to unique urban characteristics and local policies, potentially introducing analyt ical biases. The dependent variable in this study is government effi ciency, and the independent variable is the degree of digital transformation within governmental departments. 3.1.1. Government efficiency We employ the SBM-DEA and Global Malmquist productivity index to evaluate governmental efficiency (Caves et al., 1982; Malmquist, 1953; Oh, 2010; Tone, 2001, 2002). The DEA method is chosen due to its robustness in handling multiple inputs and outputs without requiring a priori weights. DEA is particularly suitable for evaluating the efficiency of government departments because it can capture the relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) in transforming inputs into outputs. Compared to other methods, such as Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), DEA's non-parametric nature allows for greater flexibility in dealing with various input-output combinations without the need for specific functional form assumptions, which can introduce bias and inaccuracies. Input factors are selected to include the quantity of government employees and the magnitude of fiscal expenditure. Output factors are chosen in accordance with the twin objectives of governmental work: economic proliferation and employment stabilization. GDP is chosen as the expected output, while the unemployment rate is selected as the unexpected output. Specific data sources can be found in Table 1. Table 1 Measurement of input and output factors of Government Efficiency. First grade indicators Second grade indicators Sources Input Government employees Employment in Urban Units of Public Administration, Social Security, and Social Organizations (Ten thousand people), in China Provincial Statistical Yearbook Fiscal expenditure Local Fiscal General Budget Expenditure (Billion yuan), in China Provincial Statistical Yearbook Expected output GDP Gross Domestic Product (Billion yuan), in China Provincial Statistical Yearbook Unexpected output Unemployment rate Urban Registered Unemployment Rate (%), in China Provincial Statistical Yearbook C.

chunk_007,Unknown,1047,3,"Within the framework of DEA and Malmquist productivity index, the FGNZ decomposition method constitutes an advanced strategy for breaking down efficiency alterations (F¨are et al., 1994). It partitions Efficiency into Efficiency Change (EC) and Technological Change (TC). Efficiency Change (EC) reflects the overall alterations in a production unit's operational efficiency over time. It encompasses both pure tech nical efficiency and scale efficiency changes, indicating how effectively inputs are converted into outputs as a result of improvements in pro cesses or better use of existing technologies. Technological Change (TC) represents the shifts in the production frontier between two time points, demonstrating whether there has been a transformation in production technology. It captures the impact of innovation and the adoption of new technologies on the production process. The relationship is as follows: Gov eff = Gov EC(CRS) × Gov TC(CRS) (29) EC(CRS) = Dt+1 c ( Xt+1, Yt+1) Dt c(Xt, Yt) (30) TC(CRS) = [ Dt c ( Xt+1, Yt+1) Dt+1 c ( Xt+1, Yt+1) × Dt c(Xt, Yt) Dt+1 c (Xt, Yt) ]1 2 (31) where Gov eff is the Government Efficiency, (Xt, Yt), ( Xt+1, Yt+1) refer to the input-output vector in period t and t + 1；Dt c, Dt+1 c refers to the distance function based on constant returns to scale in period t and t + 1, namely the compression ratio of actual output of decision making unit to optimal output; Dt v, Dt+1 v represents the distance function based on var iable returns to scale in period t and t + 1; Dt c, Dt+1 c , Dt v, Dt+1 v can be ob tained by DEA. In the context of utilizing the FGNZ decomposition method to gauge governmental efficiency, the aforementioned concepts can be applied as follows: Gov EC assesses whether governmental departments or orga nizations are improving overall efficiency by optimizing their funda mental workflows and procedures, such as processing citizen applications, implementing policies, or collecting and analyzing data. Gov TC examines whether the government is incorporating new tech nologies or tools to enhance efficiency, including the adoption of novel information systems, AI tools, or data analysis utilities. 3.1.2. Government digital transformation In this study, we selected four representative government de partments for their diverse functions and significant roles within the Chinese governmental structure. These departments include provincial branches of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), the Department of Ed ucation (DoE), the Department of Civil Affairs (DoCA), and the Depart ment of Finance (DoF). These departments oversee key public service sectors such as finance, education, and civil affairs, each representing different facets of governmental operations, including monetary policy formulation, education policy implementation, social welfare manage ment, and financial budgeting and planning. Their pivotal roles suggest that their degree of digital transformation could have profound impli cations for overall governmental efficiency, justifying their selection for this investigation. The theoretical foundation of text analysis lies in its ability to extract key information through the automated processing of large-scale textual data, thereby enabling the quantitative analysis of complex phenomena. Text analysis has been widely applied in social science research, including policy analysis, public opinion monitoring, and social trend studies, with its effectiveness and reliability extensively validated (Arteaga-Garavito et al., 2024; Cantarella et al., 2024). In this study, text analysis methods help us systematically quantify and track the process of government digital transformation, providing reliable data support for evaluating its impact on government efficiency. Adopting the methodologies propounded by Chen et al. (2018), we processed unstructured textual data to derive the Government Digital Transformation index. The initial step entails the collection and orga nization of policy documents and reports related to governmental digital transformation, from which we extract pertinent keywords.1 Subse quently, we compile the text of the “Government Information Disclosure Annual Report” from the aforementioned four departments across all 31 provinces in China, spanning from 2012 to 2022. In the third phase, we extract sentences which encompass the keywords concerning the gov ernment's digital transformation. Proceeding to the fourth stage, we calculate the degree of digital transformation of the sample departments in a given year, using Eq. (32) as an exemplar, where i symbolizes the provincial departments and t designates the year. Compared to keyword frequency text analysis, the superior advantage of analyzing the gov ernment's digital transformation degree using the proportion of relevant sentences lies in circumventing measurement biases caused by keyword repetition within brief text segments. Government Digital Transformationi,t = Proportion of relevant sentencesi,t = word number of relevant sentencesi,t total number of words in the Reporti,t . (32) The “Government Information Disclosure Annual Report” is a transparency initiative by the Chinese government that mandates each department to release an annual report detailing their progress and ac tivities in information disclosure. These reports generally cover the de partment's information disclosure practices, key advancements, specific measures undertaken, results achieved, challenges faced, and future plans. This practice aims to foster a culture of openness and account ability within the public sector. By analyzing these reports, we can effectively gauge a department's degree of digital transformation and compare it across different departments due to the standardized reporting format. Despite the significant advantages of text analysis, this method has some limitations and potential biases: (1) Keyword selection bias: If not comprehensive, it may omit important information and fail to fully reflect all aspects of digital transformation. (2) Text subjectivity: Different authors might use varying language and wording, increasing complexity and subjectivity, potentially affecting the accuracy of the analysis. (3) Context dependency: Keywords might have different meanings in different contexts, and simple frequency analysis might not capture their true meaning accurately. To mitigate these issues, we implemented multiple rounds of keyword screening and validation. Through several rounds of expert consultations and validations, we ensured the comprehensiveness and accuracy of keyword selection. We relied on existing literature and policy documents and involved domain experts in the keyword screening process. Additionally, we combined quantitative and quali tative analysis methods. Alongside keyword frequency analysis, we conducted in-depth analysis of specific textual content to verify the reasonableness of the text analysis results. To assess the coherence of digital transformation efforts within a given governmental jurisdiction, we calculated the variance (VAR) of digital transformation levels among the four departments. A greater variance implies poorer coherence in the digital transformation efforts of the respective region's government. 1 Keywords: Digital, Data, Innovation, High-tech, Circuit, Intelligent, Block chain, Technology, Influencer, Network, Online, Remote, Internet, E-commerce, Computing Power, Algorithm, 5G, Autonomous Driving, Wisdom, Electronic, Platform, Sharing, Quantum, Encryption, Networking, Robot, Cloud Computing, Fiber Optic, Video, Animation, Game, Software, Communication, Website, Netizen, WeChat, Official Account, Microblog (all in Chinese).

chunk_008,Unknown,729,3,"3.1.3. Control variables In addition to the central independent and dependent variables, this study incorporates six control variables: urbanization rate, industrial structure, level of financial development, electricity gap, disposable income, and natural disasters. These variables could exert direct or in direct effects on the government's digital transformation and operational efficiency. Urbanization rate (UR) is a significant factor as urban areas tend to facilitate and embrace digital transformation due to superior infra structural elements and greater Internet accessibility. As urbanization advances, the government needs to enhance its operational efficiency to meet increasingly complex administrative requirements. Industrial structure (IS) also plays a role, as different industrial structures shape the demand and feasibility of digital transformation within government sectors. For example, industries dominated by information technology or finance are likely to ease the implementation of digital trans formation, whereas industries such as heavy industry or agriculture might encounter more obstacles. The level of financial development (LFD) in a region is another crucial factor. Regions with high financial development usually have more capital and resources to invest in digi talization. Financial progress can create more effective incentive mechanisms and market conditions, encouraging the government to boost its operational efficiency. Disposable income (DI) influences government digital transformation as well. In regions with higher disposable income, residents' demands for government services are likely higher, which could drive the government to adopt digital trans formation to improve the quality and efficiency of services. Addition ally, disposable income might affect the rate of digital technology access and usage among residents, impacting the outcome of the government's digital transformation. Lastly, natural disasters (ND) present challenges that can motivate the government to pursue digital transformation. Frequent natural disasters could challenge the government's emergency response and resource allocation capabilities, prompting the need for digital transformation to enhance efficiency in these areas. Effective management of natural disasters by the government might also elevate public trust, further driving digital transformation efforts. Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for these control variables. 3.2. Empirical model In alignment with hypotheses H1 and H2 delineated in the theoret ical analysis segment, and considering the characteristics of the data, we implement the Fixed Effects Panel Model for empirical verification, as illustrated in Eq. (33). As per hypothesis H3, a high degree of coordi nation in digital transformation can enhance its contribution to governmental efficiency. This is based on the premise that smoother digital transformation is achievable when there is high coordination among departments, allowing for better information sharing, process unification, and the avoidance of duplicate efforts. Consequently, the likelihood of a successful digital transformation increases, thereby enhancing governmental efficiency more effectively. Conversely, if the level of coordination is low, departments may encounter various impediments during the digital transformation, such as difficulties in sharing information and inconsistencies in work pro cesses. These challenges can diminish the impact of digital trans formation, thereby reducing its role in augmenting governmental efficiency. However, the degree of coordination itself does not directly impact governmental efficiency, leading us to consider it a moderator variable. We employ a Moderating Effect Model based on Fixed Effects for empirical verification to investigate whether the coordination of digital transformation within government departments can effectively augment governmental efficiency, as depicted in Eq. (34). effi,t = α0 + α1PBoC + α2DoE + α3DoCA + α4DoF + αX + γi + μt + εi,t (33) effi,t =β0 +β1PBoC+β2DoE+β3DoCA+β4DoF+β5VAR+β6Digital×VAR +αX+γi +μt +εi,t (34) In Eqs. (33) and (34), effi,t signifies the government efficiency and its decomposed indicators, encompassing Gov MI, Gov EC and Gov TC. X denotes a series of control variables. γi and μt symbolize regional and time fixed effects, while εi,t is error term. Digital refers to any of the four types of government digital transformation. The connotations of other variables remain consistent with those delineated in the variable description segment. The key coefficients within the equations demand our attention: α1,α2,α3,α4 assess the respective influences in terms of direction and magnitude of the four government departments on governmental efficiency; β6 quantify the impact of digital trans formation discordance among departments on the efficiency enhance ment effects of a departmental digital transformation. 4.

chunk_009,Unknown,1044,3,"empirically examine the impact of government digital transformation on the decomposed indicators of government efficiency. Table 3 shows the impact of digital transformation in different government departments on government efficiency, measured through multiple efficiency indicators (Gov MI, Gov EC, Gov TC). Firstly, the digital transformation of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has a relatively limited impact on improving government effi ciency. The coefficient for PBoC on the overall government efficiency index (Gov MI) is 0.122, significant at the 1 % level (t-value of 2.65). However, PBoC's impact on other efficiency indicators is not significant, indicating that its digital transformation has a limited effect on these aspects of efficiency improvement. This conclusion aligns with the literature on the independence of central banks, which posits that to fulfill their functions, central banks must maintain a certain degree of separation from other government departments (Taylor, 2013). Secondly, the Department of Education (DoE) shows significant ef fects in certain areas of government efficiency. Specifically, the DoE's digital transformation has a coefficient of 0.160 on the overall govern ment efficiency index (Gov MI), significant at the 1 % level (t-value of 3.60). But the same with PBoC, its impact on other efficiency indicators is not significant. Other empirical findings related to the Department of Education validate the effectiveness of digital transformation (Ibrayeva and Yegemberdiyeva, 2022) and also provide evidence for the chal lenges faced by the digital transformation of educational departments (Alotaibi, 2021). Thirdly, the Department of Civil Affairs (DoCA) has shown a signif icant and relatively comprehensive impact on improving government efficiency. It has promoted MI, EC, and TC at the 1 % significance level. Using the impact on MI as an example, its influence coefficient (0.609) is significantly larger than that of PBoC and DoE, approximately five times the coefficient of PboC (0.122). These findings are generally consistent with previous research conclusions (Dener et al., 2021; Angin and Adawiyah, 2023). Similarly, the digital transformation of the Department of Finance (DoF) has also shown significant positive effects on most efficiency in dicators. The digital transformation of the DoF has significantly enhanced overall government efficiency, efficiency change, and tech nological change. While a substantial body of literature has analyzed the effects of digital finance (Bollaert et al., 2021; Bertoni et al., 2022) or the digital transformation of banks (Yang et al., 2024), our study is the first to validate the development effects of digital transformation from the perspective of the Department of Finance. The observed differences in the impact of digital transformation across various government departments can be attributed to the nature and scope of their functions. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) and the Department of Education (DoE) are highly specialized and function- focused departments, primarily dedicated to their respective core re sponsibilities. The PBoC focuses on monetary policy and financial regulation (Taylor, 2013), while the DoE is concerned with educational policies and administration (Wermke and Salokangas, 2015). These departments tend to operate with a narrower scope, and their digital transformation efforts are likely to enhance their specific operational efficiency rather than the overall efficiency of the government. In contrast, the Department of Civil Affairs (DoCA) and the Depart ment of Finance (DoF) have a broader and more integrative role within the government. These departments interact extensively with various other government entities, providing essential services and support that empower multiple sectors (Zhao et al., 2012; Allen et al., 2016). For instance, the DoCA oversees social welfare and public services, impacting areas like social security, community development, and emergency management. Similarly, the DoF manages the government's budget, fiscal policies, and financial oversight, which are critical for the efficient functioning of all government departments. As a result, their digital transformation initiatives have the potential to streamline pro cesses, improve resource allocation, and facilitate better coordination across the entire government apparatus, leading to significant improvements in overall government efficiency. In summary, these empirical findings strongly support our theoret ical framework, particularly the hypotheses H1 and H2. The significant impact of digital transformation in the Department of Civil Affairs (DoCA) and the Department of Finance (DoF) on overall government efficiency aligns with the production network theory. This theory sug gests that departments with more integrative and central roles within the governmental network are likely to exert a more substantial influ ence on the overall efficiency when they undergo digital transformation. On the other hand, the limited impact observed in the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and the Department of Education (DoE) highlights the importance of considering the functional specialization and network position of each department, as predicted by our theoretical model. This supports the notion that digital transformation's effectiveness is contingent upon the department's role and its interconnectedness within the broader governmental framework. 4.2. Robustness check To ensure the robustness of the empirical results, three robustness checks were conducted: adjusting the input-output structure of gov ernment efficiency and dividing the sample time periods. The results are presented in Tables 4 and 5. 4.2.1. Adjusted input-output structure In the first robustness check, the structure of input and output vari ables for measuring government efficiency was adjusted. Specifically, “Public Service Expenditure” was added as an input variable, repre senting expenditures on education, healthcare, transportation, and other public services. Additionally, “Per Capita Disposable Income” was added as an output variable to better reflect residents' living standards and economic development. The newly calculated government efficiency indicators (Gov MI2, Gov EC2, Gov TC2) were used as dependent vari ables in the regression analysis. The results, shown in Table 4, are consistent with the baseline regression, indicating that the main con clusions remain robust when the input-output structure is adjusted. 4.2.2. Different time periods test The second robustness check involved dividing the sample into different time periods to verify the stability of the results over time. The sample was split into two groups: 2012–2017 and 2018–2022. Separate regressions were conducted for each time period. The results, presented in Table 5, indicate that the effects of digital transformation were weaker in the first three years compared to the latter three years. Based on the regression results with MI as the dependent variable, the effect of digitalization in the Central Bank, the Department of Education, and the Department of Civil Affairs has become increasingly significant over Table 4 Robustness check: Adjusted input-output structure.

chunk_010,Unknown,687,3,"time, while the effect of digitalization in the Department of Finance has somewhat decreased. However, the significance levels remained consistent with the baseline regression, confirming the robustness of the results over different time periods. The increasing significance of digital transformation in the latter years of our study period underscores the dynamic nature of govern mental efficiency improvements over time. This progression is consis tent with the production network theory, which posits that as digital transformation deepens and becomes more widespread across various departments, the cumulative effects on governmental efficiency become more pronounced. The observed decrease in the impact of digitalization within the Department of Finance (DoF) over time might reflect the saturation effect, where initial gains from digitalization start to diminish once the department reaches a certain level of technological maturity. This finding expands on the existing theory by highlighting the potential for diminishing returns in digital transformation efforts, suggesting that continuous innovation and adaptation are necessary to sustain long- term efficiency improvements. 4.3. The impact of coordination of digital transformation on the contribution of digital transformation to government efficiency In accordance with Eq. (34), we utilize a moderation effect model grounded on panel fixed-effects to scrutinize the degree to which the coordination of interdepartmental digital transformation amplifies its contribution to governmental efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an interaction term for each independent variable (departmental digital transformation) with the discordance level (VAR) in interdepartmental digital transformation, and observe the magnitude and direction of these four interaction terms. The findings are presented in Table 6. As shown in Table 6, the discordance level (VAR) in interdepartmental digital transformation does seem to curb the contri bution of digital transformation towards governmental efficiency, although the effect is not statistically significant. The P-values for the interaction terms PBoC × VAR, DoE × VAR, DoCA × VAR, and DoF × VAR are 0.212, 0.164, 0.186, and 0.161, respectively. Despite not reaching statistical significance, these results suggest that VAR may still exert some degree of influence. The moderation analysis indicates that the level of discordance (VAR) among departmental digital transformations can dampen the overall efficiency gains. Although not statistically significant, these re sults align with the theoretical predictions of our production network framework, which emphasizes the importance of coordination and interconnectedness between departments. The production network theory suggests that efficient communication and collaboration among departments are critical for maximizing the benefits of digital trans formation. The findings here reinforce this theory by demonstrating that without adequate coordination, the potential efficiency gains from digital transformation may not be fully realized, thus supporting the hypothesis H3. This adds a new dimension to our understanding of digital government, highlighting the critical role of interdepartmental coordination in achieving optimal outcomes. 5. Conclusion This dissertation examines the impact of digital transformation on governmental efficiency, making significant theoretical contributions by introducing and applying the Production Network Model within the public sector. This model provides a novel lens through which to analyze the effects of digital transformation on the efficiency of various gov ernment departments. Our findings reveal that digital evolution within these sectors influences their performance to different extents, depending on both the inherent capacity of a department's digital transformation to enhance its operational efficiency and its position within the overall ‘Government Production Network’. These insights are substantiated through our empirical analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between digital transformation and government efficiency. By comparing the contributions of digital transformation across different departments, we identify opportunities to optimize the allo cation of digital transformation resources.

chunk_011,Unknown,1042,2,"departments located on the periphery of the ‘Government Production Network’ may have a limited impact on overall governmental efficiency. Therefore, in certain countries or regions, especially in developing areas with constrained resources, it is advisable to reallocate efforts from departments with high transformation costs and lower outputs to those with higher conversion efficiency and more central roles. This strategy aims to maximize the overall contribution of digital transformation to governmental efficiency. The results also underscore the importance of strengthening sys tematic thinking in the construction of a digital government. The digital transformation of governmental functions and operations is not merely an incremental improvement but requires a comprehensive rethinking of governmental responsibilities. As highlighted in China's “Guidelines on Strengthening the Construction of a Digital Government,” establish ing a coordinated and efficient digital governance capacity system is a critical first step. This strategy provides a valuable reference point for other nations, emphasizing the need to use digital technologies to sup port various aspects of government, including economic regulation, social management, public service, and environmental protection. Through comprehensive planning and systematic arrangements, gov ernments can better address challenges related to integrated governance coordination and differentiated service delivery, ultimately enhancing overall governance effectiveness. Despite its contributions, this study has certain limitations. The focus on a specific timeframe and set of government departments within China may limit the generalizability of the findings to other contexts or countries. Additionally, while the study highlights the importance of coordination among government departments, it does not fully explore the mechanisms through which such coordination can be achieved or the specific challenges that might arise in this process. Future research could extend the scope of this study by exploring the digital trans formation of government departments in different national contexts or by investigating the long-term impacts of such transformations. Addi tionally, future studies could delve deeper into the specific strategies and mechanisms that can enhance interdepartmental coordination, further clarifying how to maximize the benefits of digital transformation in the public sector.
